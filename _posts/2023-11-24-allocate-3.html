I realised recently there is another property allocation algorithms <a href="{% post_url 2022-09-14-allocate %}">Error-Minimising</a> and <a href="{% post_url 2022-10-31-allocate-2 %}">Balinski-Young</a> should have.
Robust allocation algorithms should produce the same results reordered for reordered weights.
This is not only about when we need this property to hold, but also about making sure we have the most canonical algorithms possible.

<p>Using <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsCheck/">CsCheck</a> it is easy enough to add this to the set of <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/CsCheck/blob/master/Tests/Allocator_Tests.cs">allocator tests</a>.</p>

<p>Ignore for the moment the new long weight versions.</p>
<p><a href="{% post_url 2022-10-31-allocate-2 %}">Balinski-Young</a> passes the test but <a href="{% post_url 2022-09-14-allocate %}">Error-Minimising</a> does not.
It has a rounding issue that produces occasional off by one differences.
Investigating further we find the weight sum is causing the problem.</p>

<p>This can be solved by using the FSum algorithm from the previous <a href="{% post_url 2023-10-09-fsum %}">post</a> with an additional <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf#page=29">compression</a> step.</p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion" class="anchor" href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>We are back to being able to say these two algorithms are the best solutions to the allocation problem.
I can't think of any other invariants the algorithm parameters could be required to satisfy.</p>
<p>If possible prefer the long weight versions as the summation has no rounding complication and is much simpler.</p>
<p>The only possible way to get to the correct algorithm is by using random testing.
The edge cases are just too infrequent with numeric algorithms to catch with example based testing.
<a href="{% post_url 2022-11-13-cscheck-3 %}">CsCheck 3</a> has recently been released with improved floating-point number generation and testing.</p>

<p>In the next post we will investigate recommendations on which data types should be used for numeric data.</p>
