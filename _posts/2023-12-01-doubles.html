<p>I sometimes hear developers say you should always use decimals in financial applications.
This suprises me as I've worked in this area for many years and would rarely recommend using decimals.
I'd argue doubles and fixed-point numbers are more sensible options.
</p>
<p>The fear of doubles originates in part from the following misleading paragraph in the Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types">floating-point numeric types</a> reference.</p>

<p>See also other example discussions:

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/693372/what-is-the-best-data-type-to-use-for-money-in-c">3</a>.
The implication here is that the required accuracy can only be achieved with decimals, and numeric performance is not often important in financial applications.
These two points couldn't be further from the truth and I'll aim to demonstate this in the rest of the post.
