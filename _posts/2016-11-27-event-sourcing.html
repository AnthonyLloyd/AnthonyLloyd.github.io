<p>One of the highlights of the year for me was the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp">farewell to frp</a> post by Evan Czaplicki.
For a long time I've been looking for a simple functional alternative to the MVC UI models.
There were a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">FRP</a> alternatives but they all had limitations.
They heavily used Signals and many had inherent memory leak issues.
Evan removed this simplifying the model dramatically.
It resulted in something truly beautiful.
A simple and composible way of building UIs.</p>
<h2>Event Sourcing</h2>
<p>Event - something that happens at a specific point (of space and time)
type Event = EventID * 'agg list</p>
<p>what does Agg ID mean? for transaction is it when transaction occured, for others it when created</p>
