<p>I recently had a light bulb moment when I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/etodd_/status/936587511580844032">tweet</a> from Evan Todd.
It helped bring together some ideas I've had for a while on software architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data characteristics excluding software functionality should dictate the system architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shape, size and rate of change of the data are the most important factors when starting to architect a system.
The first thing that needs to be done is estimate these characteristics in average and extreme cases.</p>
<p>Functional programming encourages this mindset since the data and functions are kept separate.
Data is simple and pure functions are simple. Combining them leads to needless complexity.</p>
<p>I'm going to make the case with an example.
I will argue most asset management systems store and use the wrong data.
This limits functionality and increases the complexity of these systems.</p>

<h2>Traditional Approach</h2>
<p>Most asset management systems consider <code>positions</code>, <code>profit</code> and <code>returns</code> to be their primary data.
You can see this as they normally have overnight batch processes that generates and saves <code>positions</code> for the next day.</p>
<p>This produces an enormous amount of duplicate data.
Databases are large and grow rapidly.
What is being saved is essentially a chosen set of calculation results.</p>
<p>What's worse is other processes are built on the top of this position data such as adjustments, lock down and fund aggregation.</p>
<p>This architecture comes from not investigating the characteristics of the data first and jumping straight to thinking about system entities and functionality.</p>
<h2>Data-First Approach</h2>
<p>The primary data for asset management is asset <code>terms</code>, price <code>timeseries</code> and <code>trades</code>.
All other position data are just calculations based on these.
We can ignore these for now and consider caching of calculations at a later stage.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>terms</code> data is complex in structure but relatively small and changes infrequently. Event sourcing works well here for audit and a changing schema.</li>
<li><code>timeseries</code> data is simple in structure and can be efficiently compressed down to 10-20% of its original size.</li>
<li><code>trades</code> data is a simple list of asset quantity flows from one entity to another. The data is effectively all numeric and fixed size. A ledger style append only structure works well here.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the <a href="https://www.ishares.com/uk/intermediaries/en/products/etf-product-list#!type=emeaIshares&amp;tab=overview&amp;view=list">iShares</a> fund range as an extreme example.
They have many funds and trade far more frequently than most asset managers.</p>
<p>Downloading these funds over a period and focusing on the trade data gives us some useful statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total of 280 funds.</li>
<li>Ranging from 50 to 5000 positions per fund.</li>
<li>An average of 57 trades per day per fund.</li>
<li>The average trade values can be stored in less than 128 bytes.</li>
<li>A fund for 1 year would be around 1.7 MB.</li>
<li>A fund for 10 years would be around 17 MB.</li>
<li>280 funds for 10 years would be around 5 GB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have a good feel for the data we can start to make some decisions about the architecture.</p>
<p>Given the sizes we can decide to load and cache by whole fund history, or we could look at a smaller period over many funds.
This will simplify the code, especially in the data access layer, and give a greater number of profit and return measures that can be offered.
Most of these calculations are ideally performed as a single pass through the ordered trades stored in a sensible structure.
It turns out with in memory data this is negligible processing cost and can just be done as the screen refreshes.</p>
<p>More advanced functionality can be offered, such as looking at a hierarchy of funds and perform calculations at a parent level, with various degrees of filtering and aggregation.
As the data is bitemporal we can easily look at any previous time and ask questions such as what was responsible for a change in a calculation result.
Since the data is append only we can just update for latest additions and save cloud costs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By first understanding the data, we can build a system that is simpler, faster, more flexible and cheaper to host.</p>
<p>Software developers cannot always answer questions on the size of their system's data. It's been abstracted away from them.
People are often surprised that the full fund history can be held in memory.</p>
<p>We are not google. Our extreme cases will be easier to estimate.
Infinitely scalable by default leads to complexity and poor performance.</p>
<p>With cloud computing, where architectural costs are obvious, right sizing is essential.</p>
