<p><a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion">Fsion</a> is an EAVT (Entity, Attribute, Value, Time) time-series database for F#.</p>
<p>The main idea is by storing value updates as compressed data series, an embeded in memory
database can be created that is orders of magnitude smaller and faster than traditional
database solutions.
A functional in memory database can also be made more type-safe with a simpler API.
Other key ideas can be found <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion#key-ideas">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fsion has been designed with the finance domain in mind but could be equally applicable to
domains that requires a degree of time-series, historic query or audit functionality.</p>
<p>This series of blogs and <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion">repo</a> have been submitted
for the Applied F# Challenge in the category of F# in your domain (finance).</p>
<p>The following sections outline the main <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion">Fsion</a> components.</p>
<h2>SetSlim and MapSlim</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion/SetSlim.fs">SetSlim.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion.Tests/SetSlimTests.fs">SetSlimTests.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion/MapSlim.fs">MapSlim.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion.Tests/MapSlimTests.fs">MapSlimTests.fs</a></p>
<p><code>SetSlim&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>MapSlim&lt;K,V&gt;</code> are low memory, high performance replacements for the mutable
collections <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;</code>.
A previous <a href="{% post_url 2018-12-14-mapslim %}">post</a> covers their design and ~50% performance
improvement.</p>
<p>An important additional feature of these collections is that they do not need to be locked for
read while updates are being applied.
This combined with <a href="{% post_url 2019-03-29-io %}">IO</a> will hopefully result
in a completely lock-free multi-theaded read model for Fsion.</p>
<h2>DataSeries</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion/DataSeries.fs">DataSeries.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion.Tests/DataSeriesTests.fs">DataSeriesTests.fs</a></p>
<p>DataSeries represent an ordered table of Date, Transaction Id and <code>int64</code> encoded Values with
the latest values at the the top.
The next post <a href="{% post_url 2019-05-17-fsion-01-size %}">Fsion: 1. Size</a> demonstrates the data
compression that can be achieved using this data structure.</p>
<p>DateSeries also naturally support sets with add and remove operations.
This is much easier than managing foreign keys sets in traditional databases and will come in
handy when automatic indexes are added.</p>
<h2>Transactor</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion/Transactor.fs">Transactor.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion.Tests/TransactorTests.fs">TransactorTests.fs</a></p>
<p>The Transactor is responsible for making concurrent transactions consistent before persisting
and notifying subscribered Selectors.</p>
<p>Transactions are created from a Selector Store with any new Entity Ids and Transaction Id
following on from the Stores Ids.
The Transactor if necessary (due to concurrent transactions) corrects these.
Any corrected transactions have <code>transaction_based_on</code> set to the original Transaction Id.
Other processes would need to resolve data conflicts based on required business logic.</p>
<p>Transactions are themselves Entity Types so any context data such as user, process or source
can be added.</p>
<h2>Selector</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion/Selector.fs">Selector.fs</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/Fsion/blob/master/Fsion.Tests/SelectorTests.fs">SelectorTests.fs</a></p>
<p>Selector is responsible for applying Transactions to a Store, persisting a snapshot and has
an API for selecting data.</p>
<p>The Selector takes the Transaction Id in all API functions and can be performed at the at
any historic Transaction Id.
The same results will be returned for the same call any time in the future.
This means Selection API calls are pure.</p>
<h2>View</h2>
<p><em>WIP</em></p>
<p>Views are functions that can be passed to the Selector API to make selection easier and
more type-safe.</p>
<p><code>Store -&gt; Tx -&gt; Entity -&gt; Result&lt;T,ValidationErrors&gt;</code></p>
<p>They can be thought of as as both the schema definition (when run with an empty store) and
validation function.
Mutliple views can be defined for the same Entity Type for different areas of the business
logic.</p>
<h2>Why F#</h2>
<ul>
<li>Type-safe - typed values and marshalling unstructured data into type-safe views.</li>
<li>Functional - pure repeatable API calls.</li>
<li>Robust - in handling of errors and mutli-threaded code.</li>
<li>Testing - property based testing for serialization, stress testing for threading.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Traditional databases are not efficient as highly normalised stores with full history.
A compressed in memory store is more efficient and offer much simpler functionlity with no 'mapping'.</p>
<p>The design is flexible and can scale with the Transactor and Selector as separate processes.
The Selector Store can be based on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER">FASTER</a> if the size of the
database when compressed is larger than memory.
Multiple Selector Stores can be run and filtered as a cache on the client.</p>
<p>The project continues to be work in progress.
Next steps are to make the API as type-safe as possible in terms of Attributes, Transactions
and Selection.
Work will also be done to make sure the API is resilient and performance optimised.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim is to provide functional fully type-safe database and cache functionality
with a set of best practice meta data driven satellite projects.</p>
<p>Next we will look at database size in <a href="{% post_url 2019-05-17-fsion-01-size %}">Fsion: 1. Size</a>.</p>
