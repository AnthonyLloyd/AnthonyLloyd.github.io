<p>Over the past few weeks I've been submitting improvements to some of the C# programs in the <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/">Benchmarks Game</a>.</p>
<p>When I first saw the <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/csharp.html">C# .Net Core vs Java</a> benchmarks the score was <strong>.Net Core 2.0</strong> 4 - <strong>Java</strong> 6.
This surprised me as I was under the impression .Net Core 2.0 performance would be very good.</p>
<p>I have concentrated on the 6 programs where Java was faster and not looked at the other 4 (binary-trees, spectral-norm, fasta, pidigits).</p>
<p>Below are some notes on each of these programs and some caveated conclusions.</p>
<h3>reverse-complement</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 1.39s - Java 1.10s<br />
Reversing in place and more efficient parallel processing.<br />
New Result: C# 0.79s - Java 1.10s</p>
<h3>mandelbrot</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 7.29s - Java 7.10s<br />
Simplified the parallel processing by using TPL Parallel.For.
New Result: C# 6.78s - Java 7.10s</p>
<h3>n-body</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 21.71s - Java 21.54s</p>
<p>I made many failed attempts to try to improve this result including using SMD, rem.</p>
<h3>fannkuch-redux</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 18.80s - Java 13.74s<br />
New Result: C# 14.98s - Java 13.74s</p>
<h3>k-nucleotide</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 13.76s - Java 07.93s<br />
New Result: C# 12.37s - Java 07.93s</p>
<h3>regex-redux</h3>
<p>Old Result: C# 32.02s - Java 12.31s<br />
New Result: C# 31.19s - Java 12.31s</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Good benchmark process
Out of ideas</p>
